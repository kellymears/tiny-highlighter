# tiny-highlighter

`composer require tinypixel/tiny-highlighter`

Slim, single-responsibility WordPress plugin that adds inline text highlight features to the Block Editor toolbar.

This intentionally does not support the colorpicker utility and only presents the author with explicitly define theme colors.
